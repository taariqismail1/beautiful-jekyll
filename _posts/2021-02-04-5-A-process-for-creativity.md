### The Need for Creativity
Life is problem solving. Some problems have known solutions, but others don’t. In the last couple of posts ([#3](https://taariqismail.com/2021-01-18-3-The-constraints-of-corporate-tradition-I), [#4](https://taariqismail.com/2021-01-28-4-The-constraints-of-corporate-tradition-II) we saw how __tradition shapes our thinking__ and encourages us to take the default path - __to apply old solutions to new problems.__

Coming up with new solutions requires creative thinking, but it’s actually quite hard to _intentionally_ think creatively.

### A Process for Creativity
For most people, the words ‘creativity’ and ‘process’ shouldn’t exist in the same sentence. A process is a set of rules that just need to be followed, whereas creativity is the opposite - it’s supposed to flow, without any boundaries. __There’s a middle ground, where a process provides structure for creativity.__ I’d like to share one that I picked up at a training course delivered by [Jon Leach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-leach-60941b13/).

### The A-Z Technique
Here's a quick way of developing ideas for a work or personal project. As an example, we’ll look at how we can come up with product enhancements for Substack (this platform).

#### Step 1: Write the letters A - Z down a piece of paper

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/5a.jpeg" height="200px";>

#### Step 2: Pick a theme
It shouldn’t be related to the problem you're trying to solve. For our product features project we'll take _‘museum objects’_ as a theme

#### Step 3: For each letter, write the name of an object you might find in a museum
For example:
1. D - Drum
2. R - Rug
3. V - Vase

You can start with whichever letters are easiest, but it’s important to go through all of them - you should have 26 objects.

#### Step 4: Come up with a single idea for each letter, using the objects as inspiration

For example, R - Rug. A rug is made up of many individual threads that make up a pattern. How can we translate that into an idea for Substack? Here’s a potential idea - __Substack can create a highly-curated, paid-for weekly newsletter that combines the best articles from various writers__ (similar to a traditional newspaper with sections such as politics, business and sport). Weaving a rug helped me think of bringing together disparate pieces to build a product that is greater than its constituent parts.

### Step 5: Keep going
The first few letters will be quite easy to get through, but after a while you'll hit a wall. __Force yourself to think of ideas for each letter__ - that's where the real value is. Doing this as a group is often easier (and much more fun).

All ideas are good ideas - if they aren’t immediately feasible, they might help you think about other ideas that are. By generating 26 potential ideas, you'll have plenty to play with. I need to stress this - it's important to go through all of the letters. Once you've got all your ideas down, pick the ones that might work best.

The A-Z technique works for me, but more importantly, it’s helped me see creativity as something that I can control. There are other techniques that work for different people - for example, [using scents to bring back memories](https://www.livescience.com/why-smells-trigger-memories.html). I’d be curious to hear of other ways you can nurture creativity.
