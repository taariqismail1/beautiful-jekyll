# 9. Debt, Capitalism and Politics
### Debt in the modern world
---

This is the second post summarising key ideas from the Radio 4 [series](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b054zdp6) _Promises, Promises: A History of Debt._

### Debt and the Birth of Capitalism
In a previous post we saw that debt is just a promise to pay a certain amount under certain conditions by a certain time. In the early modern period this promise took a stronger form. __Debts became more than moral obligations, and were enforced at any cost.__

This period is also known for the birth of capitalism, conventionally explained by technological and financial innovations. __Graeber notes that these were only made possible by a mass of disciplined labour - often through slavery or the exploitation of free people.__ Merchants and explorers took large loans to finance their overseas expeditions. Given debts had to be paid off, people were driven to do so by any means necessary - usually using violence and exploitation

### Politics and Debt
Over the last 50 years, Western governments have extended loans to poorer countries and then set up mechanisms to protect creditors. An example of a mechanism is the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which acts as a gatekeeper of the international debt markets.

They enforce debts through __‘structural adjustment’ policies that re-orient the debtor economies towards exports__ (so they can generate enough foreign currency to pay their loans). __This often means cutting public spending or privatising assets__, and is usually not in the best interests of the local population. Stipulations by the IMF mean self-governance is relatively impossible. __It’s another form of colonisation.__

In the IMF’s own [words](https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2001/071001.htm):

> __In about half of the 80 poorest countries, unsustainably high external debt has also become a key constraint on development__

### Future
The new millennium saw popular uprisings that aimed to expose the global bureaucratic structure that enforced debt arrangements. In a way, these are similar to the debt revolts throughout history where peasants revolted against landlords.

__Graeber suggests there must be a return to institutionalised debt forgiveness__, as there was in the ancient and medieval world. For example, the [Old Testament](https://www.bible.com/bible/114/LEV.25.NKJV) called for debts to be removed on the tenth day of the seventh month every fifty years. __In our time, this debt forgiveness exists in some ways at a personal level[^1] through bankruptcy, but there aren’t any solutions between nations.__

A middle path is the most realistic option on the international stage, where some debts are forgiven and others are paid off. Importantly, there shouldn’t be any structural adjustment policies.

[^1] In the modern world you can inherit capital but not debt. The asymmetry hasn’t always existed - bonded slavery.
