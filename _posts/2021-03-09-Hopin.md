I recently came across Hopin and wanted to share some thoughts on what’s driving its rapid growth.

### What is Hopin?
[Hopin](https://hopin.com/) is a virtual events platform founded in 2019. It caters specifically to people hosting online events - e.g. conferences, cultural fairs, job fairs.

It's an __end-to-end platform__ that helps you with setting up an event, registration, ticketing, all the way to video streaming and managing smaller breakout sessions. There's also a lobby where you can meet other attendees for 1:1 chats.

__Why not just use Zoom?__ It's a different use case. Zoom is good for meetings, and is okay for webinars. It isn't so good for hosting content (e.g. presentations) and encouraging interaction between participants.

### Business model
Their latest revenue numbers are __an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $70m.__ Where is it coming from?

* __Monthly fees:__ Organisers pay a __monthly fee__ from $99 for the limited ‘Starter’ package or $799 for the ‘Growth’ package. Larger businesses pay a lot more. It doesn't look like there's a one-off event option - that's part of their great pricing model driving recurring revenue

* __Ticket commission:__ This is around 5% of ticket sales, but depends on your plan

### Structural changes
__So how has it been able to grow so fast? And what do investors see in it?__

Hopin’s growth has been __kick-started by the pandemic__ - events have shifted online rapidly. In addition to the boost from the pandemic, there are three long term trends helping Hopin – __increased online interaction, a culture of choice, and decentralisation__

1. __Increased online interaction__
One drawback of online events is the lack of interactions and socialising between attendees. That’s going to change though - __younger generations are comfortable interacting and making friends online__ (usually through games). It’s relatively normal for them, and they’ll take these trends with them into the business world in the future. Hopin does have a 1:1 meeting space within its events platform at the moment, but the shape of this is likely to change in the future.

2. __Culture of choice__
Everything is driven by choice now (usually on-demand), and it shouldn’t be any different with events. People usually attend conferences for a handful of sessions (e.g. keynotes). __Online events give attendees more choice__ to attend specific parts they’re interested in.

3. __Decentralisation__
__People with large audiences will start hosting and monetising their own events.__ With Hopin you can now host a professional event without booking venues, dealing with logistics or all the other coordination that goes in between. All you need is engaging content and an audience – something that most creators and influencers have already.

### Threats
Every great startup has another one just a few steps behind it - in Hopin’s case there’s a company called Airmeet (also founded in 2019 and have raised $15m vs Hopin’s $672m). __They have a similar platform, but do have a free tier for small events - try it next time instead of just using Zoom.__

Talking of Zoom - this is a space they’re moving into with the launch of [OnZoom](https://blog.zoom.us/introducing-onzoom-a-marketplace-for-immersive-experiences/). They’ll offer the option to host and monetise events - they’re starting with fitness classes and smaller scale events (so it’s slightly different to Hopin’s use case focusing on business users).

There are countless technology solutions out there. __Hopin is differentiated by their smooth user experience and the fact that it’s made specifically for events.__

### Outlook
__Hopin describe the future of events as hybrid__ (rather than purely digital). People can choose to attend online (through Hopin’s platform) or in-person, giving attendees more choice. They’ve set themselves up well and are going to benefit from some long term trends. I think it’s an exciting business - and I’m looking forward to following their journey.
