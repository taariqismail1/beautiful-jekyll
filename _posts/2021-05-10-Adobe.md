A few weeks ago I came across a graph of Adobe's annual revenue and was really surprised to see their recent strong growth. Their share price has performed better than Amazon over the last five years (~400% vs ~350%). Perhaps I've been slightly out of the loop, but I hadn’t heard much about them as a growing tech company so I wanted to understand what’s behind their growth.
