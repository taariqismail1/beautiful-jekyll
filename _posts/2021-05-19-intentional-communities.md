description: An overview of intentional communities and how they can be used to re-orient urban life towards the community

A few weeks ago I compared Balaji's idea of starting a new country (‘digital first, physical last’) to an intentional community. I touched on intentional communities in that post but wanted to explore them in a bit more depth.

Here's one definition of an intentional community.

> Five or more people, drawn from more than one family, who have voluntarily come together...They seek to live beyond the bounds of mainstream society by adopting a consciously devised and usually well thought-through social and cultural alternative.

Community members are generally tied together by something greater, for example, shared interests or religion. However, intentional communities sometimes come with preconceptions - for example, thinking of them as 'hippie communes' where members isolate themselves from the rest of society and share all their income. Whilst these exist, I'd like to focus on urban, less isolated intentional communities.

## Why?
Although intentional communities have existed for a long time (as far back as 500 BCE), modernity has been the driving force for their recent prominence. The central element of society used to be the community, but this has shifted towards the nuclear family and then towards the individual. These days, people hardly know their neighbours. With increased earnings, individualism has become a dominant (to differing degrees) way of life in the West over the last century. More recently, technology is playing its role in accelerating individualism.

You can live your life without interacting with a single person because it's simply more convenient. For example, you can use the automated checkout at the shops, or use an app to have your food or goods delivered, or use Google Maps for directions if you're lost.

With the breakdown of organic communities and the rise of loneliness, people have been turning to intentional communities.

Co-living: an approximation
Co-living (not the same as house-sharing) is a model that has become popular recently. Although it isn’t strictly an intentional community, there are some shared aspects.

The idea: co-living spaces are usually commercial ventures offering short to medium lets for single people or couples. Whilst each person has their own room, they have access to common facilities and rooms to socialise, and can take part in group initiatives. Co-living spaces often have a central theme (e.g. the arts) and membership is offered to those who’ll benefit the community. The downside is that they’re a lot more expensive compared to private renting: you're essentially paying for a ready-made community.

## A model
__How do you set up an intentional community?__
1. Find some people with a similar vision and goals regarding what communal life should look like
2. Buy (or rent) properties close to each other (they don’t need to be in the same building or complex)
3. Set up a shared space for people to interact - e.g. community hall or sports centre. These shared spaces are either rented or owned by a trust the community sets up.
4. Establish a governance framework. A small membership fee will fund the maintenance of shared spaces and any community initiatives. Governance can be through a committee, similar to any non-profit.

(Alternatively, join one of the many communities that have already been set up1.)

### The role of shared spaces
Intentional communities can help re-orient urban life away from the individual and towards the community. The key element is shared spaces. The Ottomans used a similar idea to regenerate parts of cities: they'd build a mosque with a large complex (kulliye) around it. Within the complex, there would be public baths, a soup kitchen, a school, and a medical centre amongst other facilities. A modern example might have a cafe, a library, a fitness centre, and co-working spaces.

It’s worth mentioning explicitly - these communities shouldn’t be gated or isolated from the rest of society. As an intentional community grows it morphs into a ‘normal’ community and is relatively indistinguishable from one.

I’d be keen to hear your thoughts on intentional communities, especially if you have experience with them.
