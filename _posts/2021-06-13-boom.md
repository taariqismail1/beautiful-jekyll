One of my favourite childhood memories is going to Harare Airport one Friday afternoon to see the Concorde arrive in town. I forced my parents to make another relatively long drive to the airport so I could see it again; it was parked close to the edge of the airport to allow visitors another glance.

As you can imagine, I was excited when I heard of Unitedâ€™s partnership with Boom Supersonic, a new aircraft manufacturer that's looking to re-introduce commercial supersonic flight.
