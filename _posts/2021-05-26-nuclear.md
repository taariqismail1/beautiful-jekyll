title: 18. Why nuclear energy failed
subtitle: A broken promise
description: A summary of why nuclear power has failed over. It has failed to live up to its expectation as the energy of the future
---

The world needs more energy. Specifically, it needs more clean energy. Global electricity consumption has doubled over the last 30 years, and with an increased population and ambitious climate change goals, the world needs a source of cheap and clean energy, sooner rather than later.

Nuclear power was once billed as the cheap, clean energy of the future. It’s been around since the ‘50s, but the technology hasn't fulfilled its original promise, and now makes up only 10% of the world's energy production.
