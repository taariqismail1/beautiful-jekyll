title: About me
---

My name is Taariq Ismail. Introductions are hard - there's so much to cover:

- I work in corporate strategy
- I'm now playing a decent amount of tennis
- I love learning - mainly through reading and trying things out

### My story

I've spent the last chunks of my life:
- Working in consulting at <a href="https://accenture.com/" target="_blank">Accenture</a> and [OC&C Strategy Consultants](https://www.occstrategy.com)
- Studying Engineering at [St Edmund Hall, Oxford](https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk)
- Calling Harare, Zimbabwe home
